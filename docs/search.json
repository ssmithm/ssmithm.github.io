I obtained my PharmD in 2007 and MPH, with an emphasis in biostatistics and epidemiology in 2011, both from the University of Florida. I completed a Pharmacy Practice Residency at the NF/SG Veterans Affairs Hospital (2008) and a postdoctoral fellowship in Family Medicine at the University of Florida (2011). More recently, I completed a Certificate in Biomedical Informatics at the University of Florida (2019). I started my career at the University of Colorado in 2011 and returned to the University of Florida in 2014, where I lead the CVmedLab and the Center for Integrative Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease. I’m fortunate to work with an amazing group of colleagues and trainees in the Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy.\n\n\nFind me elsewhere, on occasion:\n                              \n\n\nContact\nmailssmith@cop.ufl.edu\nmailsteve@cvmedlab.org"

    "text": "The UF CV med Lab is focused on cardiovascular effects of drugs, particularly in real-world populations. This includes conventionally cardiovascular drugs (e.g., antihypertensives), but also drugs not typically associated with cardiovascular effects (antidiabetic drugs, antibiotics, antidepressants, etc…), but which have, or may have, cardiovascular consequences.\nI lead a lab of thoughtful, smart, hardworking trainees interested in studying treatments for cardiovascular disease. Interested in joining us? See the bottom of this page."
