    "text": "My lab is focused on studying adverse cardiovascular effects of common chronic diseases (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, thromboembolic disorders) and optimizing drug therapy to minimize risks of these diseases.\nA major focus is on adverse effects of chronic uncontrolled blood pressure (hypertension) and ways to optimize antihypertensive drug therapy to mitigate these adverse effects. I have particular expertise in the area of treatment-resistant hypertension.\n\n\n\nMy research spans population and clinical sciences related to cardiovascular disease and its treatment. This includes both observational research, as well as clinical trial work, primarily through my collaboration with colleagues in the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine.\nI am also interested in research on methods for using electronic health record (EHR) data, including how to minimize misclassification when measuring longitudinal drug exposure from EHR prescribing data, and methods for dealing with missingness in EHR data and biases associated with missing data.\n\n\n\nCurrent funding for the lab is through the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) via our work on optimizing antihypertensive drug selection (K01 HL138172) and high-throughput screening for antihypertensive prescribing cascades (R21 HL159576).\n\n\n\nA complete list of my lab’s journal publications can be found on PubMed or Google Scholar. Newer publications are also available via ORCID. If you do not have access to a particular journal, please email me for an author’s print."

    "text": "The UF CV med Lab is focused on cardiovascular effects of drugs, particularly in real-world populations. This includes conventionally cardiovascular drugs (e.g., antihypertensives), but also drugs not typically associated with cardiovascular effects (antidiabetic drugs, antibiotics, antidepressants, etc…), but which have, or may have, cardiovascular consequences.\nI lead a lab of thoughtful, smart, hardworking trainees interested in studying treatments for cardiovascular disease. Interested in joining us? See the bottom of this page."
