The UF CV med Lab is focused on cardiovascular effects of drugs, particularly in real-world populations. This includes conventionally cardiovascular drugs (e.g., antihypertensives), but also drugs not typically associated with cardiovascular effects (antidiabetic drugs, antibiotics, antidepressants, etc...), but which have, or may have, cardiovascular consequences.

I lead a lab of thoughtful, smart, hardworking trainees interested in studying treatments for cardiovascular disease. Interested in joining us? See the bottom of this page.

[**Steven Smith, PharmD, MPH**]{style="color: #1E354B"} is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy (College of Pharmacy) and Division of Cardiovascular Medicine (College of Medicine) at the University of Florida. I also serve as the Associate Director (population sciences) for the UF Center for Integrative Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease. My research methodology is fairly wide-ranging, encompassing clinical trial work and observational methods (e.g., with claims and electronic health record data), though my therapeutic focus is primarily in the field of hypertension.
