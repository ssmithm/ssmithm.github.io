I have particular expertise in the area of **treatment-resistant hypertension**.\n\n#### [Methods]{style=\"color: #7f7f7f\"}\n\nMy research spans population and clinical sciences related to cardiovascular disease and its treatment. This includes both observational research, as well as clinical trial work, primarily through my collaboration with colleagues in the [Division of Cardiovascular Medicine](https://cardiology.medicine.ufl.edu/).\n\nI am also interested in research on methods for using electronic health record (EHR) data, including how to minimize misclassification when measuring longitudinal drug exposure from EHR prescribing data, and methods for dealing with missingness in EHR data and biases associated with missing data.\n\n#### [Funding]{style=\"color: #7f7f7f\"}\n\nCurrent funding for the lab is through the [National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/) via our work on optimizing antihypertensive drug selection ([K01 HL138172](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9744791&icde=49548436)) and high-throughput screening for antihypertensive prescribing cascades ([R21 HL159576](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/aVEJuvDVJU--RrP-s2UzIQ/project-details/10516334)).\n\n#### [Publications]{style=\"color: #7f7f7f\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(bib2df)\nlibrary(stevemisc)\nlibrary(stringi)\n\n# load a bib file to data frame\nbib_df <- bib2df(file=\"assets/library.bib\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nSome BibTeX entries may have been dropped.\n            The result could be malformed.\n            Review the .bib file and make sure every single entry starts\n            with a '@'.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: `as_data_frame()` was deprecated in tibble 2.0.0.\nℹ Please use `as_tibble()` instead.\nℹ The signature and semantics have changed, see `?as_tibble`.\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the bib2df package.\n  Please report the issue to the authors.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nColumn `YEAR` contains character strings.\n              No coercion to numeric applied.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# clean entries\nbib_df$TITLE <- stri_replace_all_regex(bib_df$TITLE, \"[\\\\{\\\\}]\", \"\")\nbib_df$JOURNAL <- stri_replace_all_regex(bib_df$JOURNAL, \"[\\\\{\\\\}]\", \"\")\nbib_df$BOOKTITLE <- stri_replace_all_regex(bib_df$BOOKTITLE, \"[\\\\{\\\\}]\", \"\")\n\n# convert a single row back to .bib entry\nbib_entry <- paste0(capture.output(df2bib(bib_df[1,])), collapse=\"\")\nbib_entry\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"@Article{Smith2013,  Author = {S.M. Smith},  Journal = {Pharmacotherapy},  Title = {Epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment of resistant hypertension},  Volume = {33},  Year = {2013},  Abstract = {Resistant hypertension is a common clinical problem, which, until recently, has received little attention in the medical literature. With this increased attention has come a considerably better understanding of disease epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment, yet much remains unknown. Current data suggest that the prevalence of resistant hypertension has been increasing in recent decades, a concerning finding given that resistant hypertension appears to be associated with a poorer prognosis than nonresistant hypertension. The most appropriate management for these patients has not been fully elucidated, but a multifaceted approach incorporating accurate diagnosis, identification, and removal of substances that interfere with blood pressure, dietary and lifestyle management, and treatment with rational drug combination therapy can be quite effective in controlling blood pressure in these patients. Newer therapies, both pharmacologic and interventional procedures, are under study and may hold promise in the future treatment of resistant hypertension. This review highlights recent research on disease epidemiology and prognosis, and it describes the current body of literature on the treatment of this increasingly common condition. © 2013 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.},  Doi = {10.1002/phar.1297},  Issn = {18759114},  Issue = {10},  Keywords = {aldosterone antagonists,hypertension,renal denervation,resistant hypertension,spironolactone}}\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# print out the citation\n  print_me <- paste0(stevemisc::print_refs(bib_entry,csl = \"apa.csl\",\n                                        spit_out = FALSE,\n                                        delete_after = FALSE), collapse=\" \")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nI'm going to assume this is a .bib entry...\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  cat(print_me)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nSmith, S.
