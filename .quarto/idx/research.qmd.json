I have particular expertise in the area of **treatment-resistant hypertension**.\n\n#### [Methods]{style=\"color: #7f7f7f\"}\n\nMy research spans population and clinical sciences related to cardiovascular disease and its treatment. This includes both observational research, as well as clinical trial work, primarily through my collaboration with colleagues in the [Division of Cardiovascular Medicine](https://cardiology.medicine.ufl.edu/).\n\nI am also interested in research on methods for using electronic health record (EHR) data, including how to minimize misclassification when measuring longitudinal drug exposure from EHR prescribing data, and methods for dealing with missingness in EHR data and biases associated with missing data.\n\n#### [Funding]{style=\"color: #7f7f7f\"}\n\nCurrent funding for the lab is through the [National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/) via our work on optimizing antihypertensive drug selection ([K01 HL138172](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9744791&icde=49548436)) and high-throughput screening for antihypertensive prescribing cascades ([R21 HL159576](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/aVEJuvDVJU--RrP-s2UzIQ/project-details/10516334)).\n\n#### [Publications]{style=\"color: #7f7f7f\"}\n\nA complete list of my lab's journal publications can be found on [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/steven.smith.4/bibliography/public/) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3MKlN-EAAAAJ&hl=en).
